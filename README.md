Developed ergonomic utensils to assist people living with disabilities
Inclusive Kitchen Solutions: Ergonomic Utensil Design for Hand Disabilities

This project aims to address the challenges faced by individuals with various hand disabilities when using kitchen utensils. 
Many kitchen appliances are currently designed for individuals with full use of their hands, neglecting the 
needs of those with conditions such as arthritis, tendonitis, numbness, or temporary impairments like broken hands in casts.

The objective of this project is to develop ergonomic kitchen utensils that are easy to use, comfortable, and safe for people with 
hand disabilities. These designs will not be entirely new inventions but rather enhancements of existing utensils like knives, 
spoons, and chopping boards. The goal is to make these everyday tools accessible to everyone, ensuring they can be used effectively and without pain.

Key design requirements include:

- Creating utensils that assist users in gripping and using the tools with ease.

- Utilizing simple, smooth materials that reduce stress and strain during use.
- Ensuring the products are practical, slightly restrained in style, and highly functional.
- The target audience for these designs includes individuals with arthritis, tendonitis, hand injuries, 
or numbness, providing them with the ability to perform daily kitchen tasks independently and comfortably.

This project seeks to improve the quality of life for people with hand disabilities by making common kitchen activities more accessible and manageable.
